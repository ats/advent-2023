# So, 33332 and 2AAAA are both four of a kind hands, but 33332 is stronger
# because its first card is stronger. Similarly, 77888 and 77788 are both a full
# house, but 77888 is stronger because its third card is stronger (and both
# hands have the same first and second card).
#
# To play Camel Cards, you are given a list of hands and their corresponding bid
# (your puzzle input). For example:

# 32T3K 765
# T55J5 684
# KK677 28
# KTJJT 220
# QQQJA 483

# This example shows five hands; each hand is followed by its bid amount. Each
# hand wins an amount equal to its bid multiplied by its rank, where the weakest
# hand gets rank 1, the second-weakest hand gets rank 2, and so on up to the
# strongest hand. Because there are five hands in this example, the strongest
# hand will have rank 5 and its bid will be multiplied by 5.
#
# So, the first step is to put the hands in order of strength:
#
# 32T3K is the only one pair and the other hands are all a stronger type, so it
# gets rank 1. KK677 and KTJJT are both two pair. Their first cards both have
# the same label, but the second card of KK677 is stronger (K vs T), so KTJJT
# gets rank 2 and KK677 gets rank 3. T55J5 and QQQJA are both three of a kind.
# QQQJA has a stronger first card, so it gets rank 5 and T55J5 gets rank 4.

# Every hand is exactly one type. From strongest to weakest, they are:

#  - Four of a kind, where four cards have the same label and one card has a different label: AA8AA
#  - Full house, where three cards have the same label, and the remaining two cards share a different
#     label: 23332
#  - Three of a kind, where three cards have the same label, and the remaining two cards are each i
#     different from any other card in the hand: TTT98
#  - Two pair, where two cards share one label, two other cards share a second label, and the
#     remaining card has a third label: 23432
#  - One pair, where two cards share one label, and the other three cards have a different label

#  - High card, where all cards' labels are distinct: 23456

#
# If two hands have the same type, a second ordering rule takes effect. Start by
# comparing the first card in each hand. If these cards are different, the hand
# with the stronger first card is considered stronger. If the first card in each
# hand have the same label, however, then move on to considering the second card
# in each hand. If they differ, the hand with the higher second card wins;
# otherwise, continue with the third card in each hand, then the fourth, then
# the fifth.
